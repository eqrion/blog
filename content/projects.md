Every once in a while I get enough time to work on a side project. They're nothing revolutionary. But sometimes they can be kind of neat. I try and write an article when that [happens](../tags/project).

The source for all of my projects can be found on [Github](https://github.com/rlhunt):

* [wordament](https://github.com/rlhunt/wordament) - A cracker for wordament boards written in Rust
* [dash](https://github.com/rlhunt/dash) - an end to end implementation of a programming language and companion vm, written in C
* [netmod](https://github.com/rlhunt/netmod) - C++ reliable networking protocol
* [kayak](https://github.com/rlhunt/kayak) - C++ data structures and algorithms library
* [sensor](https://github.com/rlhunt/sensor) - a rough C software renderer (mostly just a rasterizer)

This site is made with [static templates](https://gohugo.io), and you can view the source [here](https://github.com/rlhunt/dreamingofbits).

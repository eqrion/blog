My name is Ryan Hunt and that's a picture of me on Mt. Haleakalā in Maui.

I'm a software engineer, and I currently work on making [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) better at [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org).

I usually write about native code, graphics, and networking.

You can contact me at [@eqrion](https://twitter.com/eqrion), and I also monitor the comments. Thanks!

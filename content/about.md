Hey, you're reading my blog. Welcome!

My name is Ryan Hunt, and I write about computer science and coding. I especially enjoy writing about native code, graphics, and networking.

You can contact me for corrections, comments, and concerns at [@eqrion](https://twitter.com/eqrion). I also try and monitor the comments. Thanks!
